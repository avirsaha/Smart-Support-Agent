## ⚠️ Note on Demo Data and Mock Database

This chatbot currently uses **mock databases and simulated policy data** for demonstration purposes:

* Product availability, offers, and policies are hardcoded or simulated.
* Real deployments require integration with your actual backend systems such as inventory management, CRM, or FAQ databases.
* The system architecture supports easy integration with real APIs and databases to provide live data.


## 🚀 Running the Chatbot with Docker

Build the Docker image:

```bash
docker build -t custom-chatbot .
```

Run the chatbot container:

```bash
docker run --rm -p 5005:5005 custom-chatbot
